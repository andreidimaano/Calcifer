# Calcifer
Calcifer is a Discord Study Bot that allows users to start Pomodoro Timers. 

All Commands:<br />
`c: pomodoro`<br />
`c: pomodoro [time]`<br />
`c: pom`<br />
`c: pom pom`<br />
`c: cancel`<br />
`c: help`<br />
`c: cook `<br />

## Current Features

### Pomodoro
Start a Pomodoro Timer
<br />
`c: pomodoro` start a 25 minute timer (default timer)<br />
`c: pomodoro [time]` start a [time] minute timer || time must be within 10 - 120<br />
`c: pom` start a 25 minute timer (new macro)<br />
`c: pom pom` (new macro)<br />
`c: cancel` cancel your timer<br />

### Help
Need some help? I've added a list of commands to get you started. I've also updated the bot's status. It now displays the help command
<br /><br />
`c: help` will return total amount of time studied
<br />

### Future
In the future, I will be implementing a function to check how much time is left on the timer
If you have any requests, Feel free to add them in Issues

I made the bot for Mayuko's Discord Server. If you would like to use it in your own servers, let me know by adding and issue. You can also contact me through my website. I'm currently testing the bot to see how much it would cost to make it available to the general public. I'm only in college, and I don't make money LOL. If you would like to sponsor server fees, Let me Know! :D
