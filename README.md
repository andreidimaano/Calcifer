  Inspired by my Code With Friends <a href="https://github.com/andreidimaano/rodelo">submission</a>, Calcifer is a Discord Study Bot that allows users to start Pomodoro Timers. Click this <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=781277794826715176&scope=bot">link</a> to add it to your server

Latest Feature:<br />
Start a pomodoro timer with a break! You're limited to a 5 - 30 minute break. Calcifer will automatically set the timer to 5 minutes if the timer you specify is not within this range. You can also `c: cancel` a break just like canceling a work session. 

`c: pom [time] break [time]`<br />

All Commands:<br />
`c: pomodoro`<br />
`c: pomodoro [time]`<br />
`c: pom`<br />
`c: pom pom`<br />
`c: pom [time] break [time]`<br />
`c: cancel`<br />
`c: productivity`<br />
`c: help`<br />
`c: cook `<br />

If you have any requests, feel free to add them in Issues

I'm currently testing the bot to see how much it would cost to make it available to the general public. I'm only in college, and I don't make money LOL. If you would like to sponsor server fees, Let me Know! :D
