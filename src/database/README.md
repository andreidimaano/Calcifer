<h1 align="center">ðŸ’¾Calcifer DatabaseðŸ’¾</h1>

>**I'm so sorry but that would be confidential information.**

For Calcifer's database, I used <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> because 1. there's a nice free tier and 2. Google Firestore only works well when you're hosting on Google Firebase ðŸ’¢ðŸ˜ ðŸ’¢. I've found that <a href=https://mongoosejs.com/>Mongoose</a> is a great library for working with MongoDB in node. Overall, the CRUD operations are pretty simple in MongoDB. The documentation for Mongoose is great.

<h1>Users</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/andreidimaano/Calcifer/blob/database/src/database/models/User.ts">Users</a> is a collection of users. Each Guild has it's own database populated with its Users. It is made purely for statistics. Click this <a href="https://github.com/andreidimaano/Calcifer/blob/database/src/database/resolvers/GuildResolver.ts">link</a> to look at the Guild database functions (explained below).</p>

<h3>Data Fields</h3>

`discordId: Your Discord Id`<br />
`discordTag: Your Discord Tag`<br />
`minutesStudied: How long you have studied for`<br />

<h3>Create</h3>

If you are not currently in the database, starting and *finishing* a pomodoro will add you to the database.

<h3>Read</h3>

You can query the time you have studied by typing ```c: productivity```. If you do not exist in the database, your time will be 0.

<h3>Update</h3>

Everytime a user starts and *finishes* a pomodoro, the user's total time studied will be updated. If you change your Discord Tag, the bot will still work because I reference your Discord ID, however, I won't be able to look you up on the database if you happen to Private Message me on Discord. If you use this bot in different servers, you will get different results based on each indiviual server.

<h3>Future</h3>

I'm considering adding a field where members can check for their weekly, monthly, and/or yearly time spent studying. It would cost more money though, so I'm not sure.

<h1>Discord Guild</h1>

<p> The <a href="https://github.com/andreidimaano/Calcifer/blob/database/src/database/models/DiscordGuild.ts">Guilds</a> collection contains all the servers that use Calcifer. It is made purely for statistics. Click this <a href="https://github.com/andreidimaano/Calcifer/blob/database/src/database/resolvers/UserResolver.ts">link</a> to look at the Guild database functions (explained below).</p></p>

<h3>Data Fields</h3>

`guildId: Server Identifier`<br />
`guildName: Name of the Server`<br />
`guildOwner: Discord Id of Server Owner (in case I have to reprimand the owner's constituents :)`<br />
`guildMemberCount: How many Users are in the Server`<br />


<h3>Create</h3>

Everytime a client adds a guild to a server, ```client.on('guildCreate')``` will be activated. Upon occurence aforementioned function, Calcifer executes a Create operation that will add information about the new guild to the database. Calcifer exists on a couple servers at the moment. To handle the database addition, I've added a temporary fix for the create function - everytime a user sends a message in one of these servers, the Calcifer checks if the server exists in the database and will add it accordingly.

<h3>Update</h3>

Everytime a new member is added to a guild, ```client.on('guildMemberAdd')``` will be activated and Calcifer will execute an Update operation that will update the guild's member information. The same operation occurs when a member is removed from a guild.
